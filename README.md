Store Inventory Map

Description

This project is a Java application that provides a large department store with the ability to upload a store map and add inventory items to the appropriate locations on the map. Inventory can be added, deleted, and moved, and those changes will be reflected on the uploaded map. 

I envision this application as roughly two thirds of a bigger picture project. In its final form, I would also create the "customer search end," where customers would be able to scan a QR code at the front of the store which would lead them to a web page where they can search for the product they are looking for, and they would be able to see the location on the store map.

In order to make steps towards completing the customer end of this project, this java application includes tabs for printing a QR code, as well as a view of what the customer's search bar experience would look like. 

I recommend importing this project into Eclipse IDE to view.

Reflections on process

This was my first big project in Java. At the point I was at in my programming journey while making this, I wanted to make a project that solved a business problem. There is a certain large department store I go to frequently that I find particularly frustrating to find what I want. I envisioned an easier way to search, and came up with the idea of a QR code at the front of the store that would lead me to an easy-to-use search engine. For my Java project, I decided to make an application that would serve as the backend management of this process.

The biggest learning curve of this project was learning how to use Java Swing. I learned through various sources on the internet and eventually got the hang of it. Once understanding the basics, I had to consider how to use Swing to create a UI that had a tab interface that switched screens when clicking different tabs. This was a puzzle, as each tab had its own sub-tabs that switch between the main tabs. 

This was also the first time I handled a database within an application. I knew some SQL, and familiarized with the basics of how to incorporate MYSQL. Ultimately, I kept this aspect as simple as I could make it, and I may do things differently now that I know more SQL.
